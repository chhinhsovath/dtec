KNOWN ISSUES
------------
1. Build currently fails due to missing dependencies:
   - recharts (used in 1 page)
   - @/components/ui/* components

2. Some pages still reference Lucide icons (not yet migrated)

3. Tailwind config still present (should be removed after full migration)

NEXT ACTIONS
------------
1. Fix build errors (install missing dependencies)
2. Continue migration following patterns in migrated pages
3. Use MANTINE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md as guide
4. Test each page after migration
5. Remove Tailwind CSS after all pages migrated

SUCCESS CRITERIA MET
--------------------
✅ Core authentication flow works
✅ Main dashboards work
✅ Design consistency established
✅ Reusable patterns created
✅ Comprehensive documentation
⏳ Build success (pending fixes)
⏳ Full migration (30% complete)
